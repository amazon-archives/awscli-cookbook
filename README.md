awscli Cookbook
=============
Installs the AWS Command Line Interface tools and provides a set of LWRPs for use within chef cookbooks.

Benefits
--------
The benefits of using the awscli are as follows:
* awscli is maintained by Amazon and is updated as new APIs and Services are released
* support for IAM profiles works out of the box
* automatically take advantage of features like multi-threaded _download_ that are built into the CLI tools
* no native compilation of dependencies is necessary

Requirements
------------

* Chef 11.6 or higher

Supported Platforms
-------------------
* Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04
* CentOS 6.4, 6.5
* Amazon 2014.03

  owner 'testuser'
  group 'testgroup'
  mode '0644'
end
```

```ruby

Testing
-------
In order to run the integration tests for this cookbook, you must have a valid AWS account and go through a few setup steps.
__*Please note, you may incur AWS fees when executing the kitchen integration tests.*__

### Local Configuration
The testing suites are setup to use environment variables to pass in end user specific information.

#### Variables used by .kitchen.yml
These variables are used to setup the `test_get` and `profile_test_get` (kitchen-ec2 only) suites. Kitchen will setup proper
node attributes based on these variables. See the .kitchen.yml file for information on which variables are set.

```bash
export TEST_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export TEST_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export TEST_AWS_REGION=
export TEST_BUCKET=
export TEST_KEY=
export TEST_CHECKSUM=
```

#### Variables used by .kitchen.cloud.yml
The .kitchen.cloud.yml file is used to test within EC2. In order to use it, you must configure proper AWS security credentials
as well as a few other settings. Take a look at .kitchen.cloud.yml to see which specific kitchen-ec2 variables are set from
these environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME=
export AWS_REGION=
export AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONE=
export EC2_SSH_KEY_PATH=
export AWS_EC2_AMI=
export AWS_IAM_PROFILE=
```

### AWS Configuration

#### test_get suite dependencies
The following items need to be setup properly in order to use the `test_get` suite.

* AWS S3 Bucket containing a test file
* AWS IAM Account with at least GetObject access to the bucket setup in the previous step
* AWS IAM Account API keys for the account setup in the previous step

#### profile_test_get suite dependencies
The following items need to be setup properly in order to use the `profile_test_get` suite.

* AWS S3 Bucket containing a test file
* AWS IAM Role/Profile with at least GetObject access to the bucket setup in the previous step
* AWS IAM Account API Keys for an account with enough access to run an EC2 instance

### Executing the integration tests
The `test_get` suite will download the file by
providing the credentials configured via the environment. Those files
will then be verified against the checksum you set via
`TEST_CHECKSUM`.  If the checksum does not match the downloaded file,
the tests will fail.

__Note: kitchen-ec2 profile support is waiting for a release. If you would like to test with
IAM profiles, you will need to build the kitchen-ec2 gem from source.__

The `profile_test_get` suite is only available when using the
kitchen-ec2 driver. The .kitchen.cloud.yml file is configured to use
the kitchen-ec2 driver. To enable this file, set the
`KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML` environment variable to the path for the
.kitchen.cloud.yml file.
